#Flux

Flux is a lightweight application that eases the creation of simple, multi-level websites that do not require the use of a CMS.

## Why Flux?

A lot of the websites we do here at Via are small 'brochure' sites with even smaller profit margins, rather than oversell the need for a CMS especially for clients with tight budgets I created Flux. Abstracted just enough at it's core, Flux allows us to create a multitude of sites quickly while still providing enough flexibility in custom page routing to be dangerous to more complex projects.

## To Do

It's still early days for Flux and there is a lot to do... 

* Caching - Flux's primary purpose is small, rarely edited websites therefore a good caching strategy is paramount.
* Meta - We need a way to easily provide multiple sets of meta information (title, keywords, description) to individual templates.
